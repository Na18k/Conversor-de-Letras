Freeware, and Purchasable Fonts Galore
(c)1998 by Astigmatic One Eye Foundry

The Freeware Font(s) included in this pack were created by Astigmatic One
Eye Font Foundry, (aka Brian J. Bonislawsky - Astigma).  Since November
5th, 1996, I have been creating fonts and offering them on the web to
the public.  Since then I have strived to create a full range of fonts,
from the bizarre to the sometimes nearing traditional, from picture fonts
to utility fonts, and I will continue to do so for a long time to come. 
All Astigmatic One Eye Fonts are available in Truetype format for the
Macintosh and PC compatibles, (Postscript Type 1 can be made available
upon request).

After my first year on the web, I have over 70 fonts available online
for viewing, download or purchase.  If you use my Freeware fonts don't
forget to check out what's available for purchase, after all, without
your support I will be unable to the time to offer you my free fonts
almost every month.  Any $10 or more font purchase will get the full
version of that particular font in whatever format best suits your
needs, (Postscript, or TrueType), and also a full copy of one of my
bonus fonts collection, some of my freeware fonts, and trial versions
of some of my latest releases.  Be sure to check out my full variety
of fonts, always growing.
